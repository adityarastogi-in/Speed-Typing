## Tech Stack

**Client:**  HTML5, CSS5 & Javascript

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the front-end development stack for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. Other technologies such as frameworks like React or AngularJS can be added to this stack for more complex web development projects.

HTML is used to structure content on web pages by defining tags for headings, paragraphs, lists, and multimedia content, as well as creating links between pages. CSS allows web developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page using selectors and rules. JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality to web pages by allowing developers to handle user input, communicate with servers, and create dynamic content through functions that can be called or triggered by user events.




## Working

Upon launching the app, users are presented with a simple and clean homepage that provides them with several options. They can choose to start a typing test with various prompts, view the statistics and contact me. 

Timer: The timer should be prominently displayed and easy to read, with clear indications of how much time is left. It should also have an option to pause or stop the timer in case the user needs a break or wants to retry the test.

Results display: The results display should show the user's typing speed in both words per minute (WPM) and characters per minute (CPM), as well as their accuracy rate. It should also provide a breakdown of the user's performance by showing the number of errors made, the number of words typed correctly, and the number of words left unfinished.

 As the user types, feedback should be provided in real-time to help them improve their typing speed. This could include highlighting correct letters as they are typed, displaying a score based on accuracy and speed, or providing suggestions for improving typing technique.

Retry button is used to reload a new session.

*Backspace can be used to correct the mistyping.

## Course:

This web-app is made as a final project for completion of my CS50 couse.  

CS50 is a self-paced online course in computer science offered by Harvard University for beginners with no prior programming experience. The course is presented in a first-person format by instructor David J. Malan, making it feel personal and engaging. CS50 emphasizes project-based learning through practical programming assignments, and uses Python, an easy-to-learn language widely used in industry. The course has a collaborative community of students and alumni sharing resources, tips, and advice. CS50 covers a wide range of topics from basic programming concepts to advanced data structures and algorithms, and includes lessons on real-world applications such as web development, cryptography, and machine learning. Completing CS50 earns a certificate of completion from Harvard University, which can be a valuable credential for job seekers or those advancing their careers in computer science.
